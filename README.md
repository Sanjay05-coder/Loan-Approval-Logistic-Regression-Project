 Loan Approval Model Summary (Income-Based)
 
This project uses logistic regression to predict loan approval based solely on the applicant's income. The model was trained and evaluated using a binary classification approach, where:

Target variable: Loan approval status (1 = approved, 0 = not approved)
Feature used: Income (numerical)

ðŸ“Š Model Performance
The model achieved an accuracy of 0.90, meaning it correctly predicted loan approval status 90% of the time.

A confusion matrix was used to visualize performance, showing a strong diagonal pattern â€” indicating reliable predictions.

The model is simple and interpretable, making it suitable for basic decision-making scenarios.

âœ… Conclusion

Using just the Income feature, the logistic regression model performs well in predicting loan approval. While itâ€™s a basic version, it demonstrates how a single financial metric can be used effectively for binary classification. This project is a solid foundation for further enhancement by adding more features or tuning the model.
